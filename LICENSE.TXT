Licenses

When purchasing a license from Wyomind.com, the license holder can use it for one live domain and as many staging, dev, or local domains he needs. In addition, the license is valid for an unlimited period of time. One license assigned to a domain is irrevocably linked to that domain and cannot be transferred to another domain, except in the two following cases:

    -  A transfer of the license can be performed from a staging, dev or local domain to a live domain
    - The license can be transferred if the old domain redirects definitively to the new one (301 permanent redirection)

Upgrades

Wyomind.com continuously tries to improve its products so as to offer the buyer the best functionality and usability.  Such enhancement upgrades will be available (to license holders only). 

Wyomind.com offers new license holders free upgrades to all products for a 3-month period from the date of purchase.
Free upgrades are made available to the license holder through their account created on the Wyomind.com web-site at the time of their first purchase. 

Paid upgrades are available at any time : when buying one month of upgrade, the license holder will be able to download and upgrade the version of the extension during one month from the date of purchase as when buying one year of upgrade, that period will last one year. This principle also applies to the additional month(s) a license holder can get for free after writing a review.
